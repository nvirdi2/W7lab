Reflection
This was one workshop that was not as difficult as the others in my opinion. This workshop
looked at many learning outcomes and they were pretty easy to catch on to when looking at 
class material and watching YouTube videos when really needed. This workshop was easier than the
other because I used the course website examples for reference. Inheriting a derived class from
a base class was one of the learning outcomes which I think I grasped very fast compared to others. 
The "shadow a base class member function with a derived class member function" from the learning
outcomes what very different to me since I heard of this concept for the first time. After understanding
and using each of the shadow a class member and accessing, it was not too hard. One thing I think
I could improve on is practice shadowing a base member concept more because it was just a little different
compared to other concepts. utilize custom input/output was honestly not the hardest yet not the easiest
learning outcome in this workshop.
